## About this Repository 

Managing customer data from multiple sources and building a unified Customer 360 view is not a new challenge. But it is becoming increasingly difficult with increased number of interaction channels and touch-points with customers. By combining the power of Azure Synapse Analytics with Dynamics 365 Customer Insights, we can help organizations build a comprehensive view of customers and enable them to provide the best customer experience.

This solution accelerator helps developers with all the resources needed to build an end-to-end Customer 360 solution.

## Prerequisites
To use this solution accelerator, you will need access to an [Azure subscription](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/) and a Customer Insights Environment. While not required, a prior understanding of Customer Insights, Azure Synapse Analytics and Machine Learning will be helpful.

For additional training and support, please see:

1. [Azure Synapse Analytics](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/synapse-analytics/) 
2. [Dynamics 365 Customer Insights](https://dynamics.microsoft.com/en-us/ai/customer-insights/) 
3. [Azure Machine Learning](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/machine-learning/) 

## Overview
This solution accelerator showcases the cross-solution integration of Azure Synapse Analytics and Dynamics 365 Customer Insights. The [Getting Started guide](https://github.com/microsoft/Azure-Synapse-Customer-Insights-Customer360-Solution-Accelerator#getting-started) helps you through the below steps: 
1. Deploy all the Azure resources needed for this solution. 
2. Load the sample data provided as part of the repository or bring your own data
3. Create Dynamics 365 Customer Insights Environment   
4. Configure Customer 360 Profiles: 
    * Load customer data from ADLS/Azure Synapse Analytics to Customer Insights.
    * Unify customer records coming from different CRM systems based on fields like Email, Last Name, Date of Birth etc. to get to a unique customer record
    * Configure customer activities like Leases, Workorders, Payments, Surveys
    * Create Customer Segments to be sent to CRM or other campaign management systems to run promotions for customer retention. Some sample segments: 
        * Customers whose leases are up for renewal
        * Customers with many past work orders 
        * Customer with lower satisfaction scores
    * Configure data enrichments to know customers affinity to specific brands and interests. 
3. Intelligence 
    * Configure Customer Lifetime Value using a pre-built model in CI.
    * Export the unified customer profiles from CI to Azure Synapse Analytics, train a custom ML model to predict the probablity of a customer renewing their lease, and load the model predictions to CI to be used in Segment creation. 
4. Connect to Power BI 
    * Download the Power BI report from this repository and change connections to your environment 

## Getting Started
Start by deploying the required resources to Azure. The button below will deploy Azure Synapse Analytics, Azure Machine Learning and its related resources:

[![Deploy to Azure](https://aka.ms/deploytoazurebutton)](https://portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.Template/uri/https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2Fmicrosoft%2FAzure-Synapse-Customer-Insights-Customer360-Solution-Accelerator%2Fmain%2FDeployment%2Fdeploy.json)

* Go to the [Deployment guide](./Deployment/AzureSetup.md) to set up Azure and Customer Insights environments. 
* After following the deployment guide, you can see the customer 360 profiles with the two options below: 
    * [Customer Insights environment](https://home.ci.ai.dynamics.com/) 
    * Power BI Dashboard you configured in the [CI Step 11](https://github.com/microsoft/Azure-Synapse-Customer-Insights-Customer360-Solution-Accelerator/blob/main/Deployment/CustomerInsightsSetup.md#step-11-power-bi-set-up)
